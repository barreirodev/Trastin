# Trastin
Serious game that combines the development of balance in children and the learning of recycling.

This is an early version of the code with the game working. These are the things I want to improve: 
- Make a relationship schema to see who should know whom.
- Recycle the boxes and the decoration of the park with object pool
- Change the singletons to static classes
- Tests
- Create a hub for the games
- Only one scene for the menu
- Restructure the GameFacade
- Clean up the code
